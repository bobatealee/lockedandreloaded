<b>PERFORMANCE & STABILITY:</b><br><br>

Implemented a new crash report system:<br>

<ul><li>Detailed information on crashes will be sent to us automatically to better help with stabilizing the game. This can be disabled in the Advanced Options.<br><br>

<li>NOTE: Automatic crash reports will be disabled if the game detects that mods are installed. (Custom hitsounds and HUDs are excluded)</ul>

Overall stability improvements based on generous community feedback and testing.<br><br>

<b>GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:</b><br><br>

Implemented a version of Valve Anti-Cheat as seen in our newer titles.<br>

<ul><li>This new detection system is able to track down suspicious players and disruptive bots much faster than usual, as well as provide a prompt response and action towards user reported accounts.<br><br>

<li>We will be regularly updating our systems to counter the latest disruption methods. If you would like to tip us on how to improve our tech, send us an email at YouLiked@Chucklenuts.com. We greatly appreciate it!</ul>

sv_pure is now set to 0 on Matchmaking servers.<br>

<ul><li>We are absolutely blown away by our modding community and the amount of creativity that goes into making custom models, animations, and sounds. Customization is the grass roots of creative freedom, and we want to honor that.</ul>

Casual games that time out will now enter Sudden Death.<br><br>

<b>SETTINGS:</b><br>

<ul><li>Added an option for viewmodel weapon sway.<br><br>

<li>Colorblind options have been massively improved thanks to community support.</ul>

<b>CAPTURE THE FLAG:</b><br><br>

CTF maps now follow a new ruleset:<br>

<ul><li>One round, first team to 2 captures wins.<br><br>

<li>Preset, non-extendable time limit (Sudden Death at time out.)</ul>

<b>MANN vs. MACHINE:</b><br>

<ul><li>Every map now has a designated Bot Spawner. Use credits to deploy metallic allies!<br><br>

<li>Various bugs have been (hopefully) fixed. Let us know if we missed any.</ul>

<b>MATCHMAKING:</b><br><br>

Reintroduced Arena Mode to both Casual and Competitive Matchmaking.<br><br>

Added a new mode to Casual Matchmaking: Arena Respawn.<br>

<ul><li>Capturing the Control point in this mode will revive your team.<br><br>

<li>All existing Arena maps are now compatible with Arena Respawn.</ul>

Improved overall matchmaking performance -- finding games should be much faster, accommodating for overseas party members.<br><br>

<b>MAPS:</b><br><br>

New additions have been added to Casual matchmaking:<br>

<ul><li>Bagel, Databank, Shoreleave, and Slaughter</ul>

A new MvM campaign is now available: Last Mann Standing!<br>

<ul><li>Tour through Coastrock, Powerplant, and Area 52 to finally beat Gray's robots!</ul>

<b>CHECKPOINT MODE:</b><br><br>

Use your keycards at checkpoints to open and close helpful shortcuts!<br><br>

The following maps will be getting a "special" suffix version to test out checkpoints:<br>

<ul><li>Turbine, Powerhouse, Databank, Asteroid, and Junction</ul>

<b>ITEMS & CRAFTING:</b><br><br>

Introducing Upgrades! Use your hard earned metal to craft lethal Attachments for your arsenal. This system will serve as one of TF2's first resource sinks.<br>

<ul><li>Attachments can be used by selecting them in your backpack and applying them to a compatible weapon. Attach scopes, silencers, bayonets, and more!<br><br>

<li>Trade up your Attachments for potentially stronger ones! You may even craft an ultra-rare Polished Attachment!<br><br>

<li>Attachments cannot be traded to other players, gifted, or sold on the Market for one week after they are crafted.</ul>

In addition, metal can now be used to refurbish War Paints.<br>

<ul><li>Right click a War Paint Kit or Decorated weapon and click Refurbish.<br><br>

<li>The more metal you use to refurbish, the more you can visually repair your item.</ul>

<b>WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS:</b><br><br>

Righteous Bison<br>

<ul><li>We have reverted the stats of this weapon to a previous, more effective version. We will tweak its power if necessary in future patches.<br><br>

<li>Fixed a bug where the Righteous Bisons projectiles would not fire when standing on slopes and when near other map geometry.</ul>

Flamethrowers<br>

<ul><li>Slightly reduced the overall opacity of flame particles.</ul>

Phlogistinator<br>

<ul><li>Updated fire particles as provided by Digits and Chaofanatic.<br><br>

<li>User is no longer invulnerable for a short period of time when activating Mmmph.<br><br>

<li>User cannot be Crit boosted by Kritzkrieg Medics or Halloween Candy.<br><br>

<li>Mmmph Meter now takes longer to fill up, and drains twice as fast.<br><br>

<li>Secondary fire is now an electric shockwave that pushes players and nullifies projectiles in a cone shaped area, similar to the Short Circuit.</ul>

Manmelter<br>

<ul><li>Updated fire particles as provided by Digits and Chaofanatic.<br><br>

<li>Extinguishing teammates and firing crits should be much less blinding now.</ul>

Pomson 3000<br>

<ul><li>Added some missing third person animations.<br><br>

<li>Projectile is now a hitscan laser bolt.<br><br>

<li>Firing and reload speeds have been increased.</ul>

Southern Hospitality<br>

<ul><li>Earns guaranteed critical hits on bleeding enemies.<br><br>

<li>Repairs 20% more building damage per hit.<br><br>

<li>Increased damage to Sappers.</ul>
        
The following weapons are being reverted to previous versions and will be better adjusted according to community feedback and internal testing:<br>

    <ul><li>The Dead Ringer, Baby Face's Blaster, Natascha, and The Brass Beast</ul>
        
<b>COSMETICS & SKINS:</b><br><br>

Hello! Rev here! As much as I really really really wanted to make a cosmetic case for this update concept, it would`ve been a massive process to go through.<br><br>

Picking out a sufficient amount of hats, unusuals, taunts, and War Paints would take much longer than I`d be comfortable with, and of course I`d need an overall theme. At the end of it all, I would still likely be hit with "Why didn't you add this one?"<br><br>

So, I'm sorry to say that I have no cosmetics planned for this one. Thematically, it seems very appropriate to me. Aside from a potential MvM Campaign, the rest of this update would be 100% free to all players. I think that's just fine.<br><br>

I'm certainly not against new items, though. Whatever cosmetics that would have been added in this update you'll just have to use your imagination.<br><br>

That said though...<br><br>

<b>NEW WEAPONS:</b><br><br>

The Afterburner<br>

<ul><li>Take flight! Alt-fire releases a self-propelling Compression blast. Good for flanking!</ul>

The Spitfire<br>

<ul><li>Take aim! Flares from the Spitfire have a much higher velocity!</ul>

The Minesweeper (AKA The Big Man)<br>

<ul><li>Stand your ground! Stickybombs cannot be pushed by compression blasts!<br><br>

<li>Destruction is easier than ever when stickies can smartly detonate on their own!</ul>

The Deputy<br>

<ul><li>Become the law with this Engineer-exclusive revolver!<br><br>

<li>Holding alt-fire will lock your crosshair onto visible enemies. Lock up to 3 total and make 'em eat lead!</ul>
                
<b>MISC. CHANGES:</b><br><br>

Updated item schema with community fixes from Andres S. (rabscootle)<br><br>

Updated/Added some tournament medals<br><br>
